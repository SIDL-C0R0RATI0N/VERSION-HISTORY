# Description

The Version History plugin is an essential tool for efficiently managing updates to your WordPress plugin. It allows you to keep track of new versions of your plugin, provide clear information to users and facilitate the updating process.

# Fonctionnalit√©s

* Shows WordPress versions
* Displays versions of plugins install and activate.
* Check for plugin updates.
* About the plugin.
* Plugin changelog.

# Installation

1. Download the `Version History (Free)` plugin from the Github repository or from the WordPress plugin library then download
`version-history` in the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Directly access the plugin from the left side menu named `Version History (Free)`.

# Utilisation

Once the plugin is activated, you can access the `Version History (Free)` page under the "Updates" or "Extensions" in your WordPress dashboard.
This page allows you to follow the latest updates of WordPress and your installed plugins.

# Avertissement 

The use of this plugin therefore has no impact on the management of WordPress updates and your Plugins.

A PRO version will be available very soon which will have more features than the Free version.
